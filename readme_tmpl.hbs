# API Reference (TBC)

{{>main}}

## Custom Adapter interface

The following methods are the minimum requirements for a custom adapter:

```
contextulise({Element} e)   => {Object}         (dependants: Interface, Interfaces)
context({Element} e)        => {string}         (dependants: Element)
length(Element e)           => {number}         (dependants: Elements, Interfaces)
methods()                   => {Array<string>}  Optional: (dependants: Element)
```

See ```lib/adapter/webdriverio.js```.

# Road Map

## v0.0.1

- [x] proof of concept
- [ ] used for a production ready system #proofOfUsefulness
- [ ] complete documentation and examples
- [ ] implement selenium driver based adapter (webdriverio, selenium-webdriver)
- [ ] implement non-selenium driver adapter (phantomjs, zombiejs)
- [ ] update documentation and examples
- [ ] rename Interface(s) => Component(s)
- [ ] rename adapter.contextulise => clone

## Thoughts

* Could this be used to write run browser driven tests, from within a browser? (e.g. using a insecure iframe ;)
* Better error handling?
* Performance?
